# Frontend

## Overview
The frontend is a React & TypeScript single-page application built with Vite. It is responsible for
- Page layout and reusable UI components
- Fetching and displaying data from the backend API

## Running the Frontend
From the *frontend/* directory, start the development server with:  
`npm run dev`

The app will be available at:  
`http://localhost:5173`
